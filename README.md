# vimrc
My personal vimrc for anyone wanting to try it.

## Usage

Fork it for your own changes and clone it into something like `$HOME/example/vimrc`. Then in your `.vimrc` just add:

    source $HOME/example/vimrc/init.vim

Since I use Vundle, the next time you open Vim (or run `:source %` on the `.vimrc`) you'll need to run `:PluginInstall` to have the plugins set up.
